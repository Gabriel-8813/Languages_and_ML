Other sources differ by considering some of these to be dialects of a single Mapoyo-Yawarana language. 
Gildea (personal communication 2014) reports that until we get some more reliable data, it appears that there are/were 3 languages: †Tamanaku, Mapoyo (ethnonym Wanai, dialect †Pémono), and Yawarana (with alternate names Orechicano, Curachicano, Woquiare).  (See also Gildea 2013.) Tamanaku is long extinct, with no attested speakers for at least a century, and therefore does not have an entry of its only in this Catalogue. Mapoyo and Yawarana are often considered separate languages, each with its own entry in this Catalogue. However, there were just some old wordlists for Yawarana and almost nothing for Mapoyo. Marie-Claude Mattéi Muller went to the Mapoyo area in the 1970s and collected some data, from which she extracted a Mapoyo wordlist (Mattéi Muller1977a, 1977b). Mattéi-Muller and Henley (1990) published Mattéi-Muller’s comparative wordlists, comparing her Mapoyo data to the published Yawarana words; they found 80% cognacy between the two and suggested maybe they were dialects of a single language. In 1998, Mattéi-Muller did fieldwork with the Yawarana, where she played a 1970s tape of Mapoyo speakers, and the Yawarana speakers (i) had difficulty understanding, but recognized Mapoyo as very closely related, and (ii) recognized the manner of speech as that of an old woman living in an isolated village far upstream. She went to this old speaker, who turned out to be the last speaker of Pémono, which seems to have been a dialect of Mapoyo (Mattéi Muller 2003).

Por una parte, es una palabra de la lengua uitoto que significa “gente de abajo”. Con esa palabra fue designado, en tiempos de la cauchería, un grupo hablante de una lengua de la familia lingüística Bora, cuya auto-designación es Feenemɨna (“Gente del centro”). En un segundo sentido, ha sido empleado por Eugene y Dorothy Minor (Diccionario Huitoto Muinane, SIL, 1971) para nombrar el dialecto Nɨpode del uitoto, del río Ampiyacu (Perú). Sin embargo, hoy en día nadie utiliza la palabra “muinane” para referirse a ese dialecto. 

En algunos textos se trató de introducir la expresión “Murui-Muinane” como una mejor auto-designación, en lugar de “Huitoto” o sus variantes, sin embargo en la actualidad son los hablantes del dialecto Bue quienes se refieren a si mismos como “Murui” y el término “Muinane” se refiere a los hablantes de la lengua Muinane-Bora. (Juan Alvaro Echeverri Restrepo, personal communication, 2014.)

[The term ""Muinane"" is ambiguous. On the one hand, it is a word of the Witoto language meaning ""people below"". By this word, in times of the rubber trade, speakers of a language of the Boran family were designated, whose self-designation is Feenemɨna (""People of the center""). In a second sense, the term was employed by Eugene and Dorothy Minor (Huitoto Dictionary Muinane, SIL, 1971) to name the Nɨpode dialect of Witoto, of the Ampiyacu River (Peru). However, nowadays nobody uses the word ""muinane"" to refer to that dialect. 

Some texts tried to introduce the term ""Murui-Muinane"" as a better self-designation, instead of ""Huitoto"" or its variants; however, currenlty it is the speakers of the Bue dialect who refer to themselves as ""Murui"", and the term “Muinane” refers to speakers of the Muinane-Bora language.]

Shipibo and Kapanawa of the Tapiche River share 90% of their vocabulary and have fewer phonological differences than American and British dialects of English (p. 17).

The Kapanawas of the Tapiche River and the (Shipibo-)Konibos are so closely related linguistically that their

The classification of these and many other varieties must remain ""open"" until further fieldwork can be done and additional material made available.

The question of how to distinguish between entities that are dialects of a single language vs. those that are separate languages is particularly serious in the case of Quechuan languages and dialects, and much work remains to be done. Though it is well-known and very clear that there are a number of distinct languages in the Quechuan complex, some very distinct, the tendency to consider them all merely dialects of “Quechua” persists in many circles.

Other sources differ by considering some of these to be dialects of Mapoyo-Yawarana. Gildea (personal communication 2014) reports that until we get some more reliable data, it appears that there are/were three languages: †Tamanaku, Mapoyo (ethnonym Wanai, dialect †Pémono), and Yawarana (with alternate names Orechicano, Curachicano, Woquiare).  (See also Gildea 2013.) Tamanaku is long extinct, with no attested speakers for at least a century, and therefore does not have an entry of its only in this Catalogue. Mapoyo and Yawarana are generally considered separate languages, each with its own entry in this Catalogue. However, there were just some old wordlists for Yawarana and almost nothing for Mapoyo. Marie-Claude Mattéi Muller went to the Mapoyo area in the 1970s and collected some data, from which she extracted a Mapoyo wordlist (Mattéi Muller1977a, 1977b). Mattéi-Muller and Henley (1990) published Mattéi-Muller’s comparative wordlists, comparing her Mapoyo data to the published Yawarana words; they found 80% cognacy between the two and suggested maybe they were dialects of a single language. In 1998, Mattéi-Muller did fieldwork with the Yawarana, where she played a 1970s tape of Mapoyo speakers, and the Yawarana speakers (i) had difficulty understanding, but recognized Mapoyo as very closely related, and (ii) recognized the manner of speech as that of an old woman living in an isolated village far upstream. She went to this old speaker, who turned out to be the last speaker of Pémono, which seems to have been a dialect of Mapoyo (Mattéi Muller 2003).",Venezuela;,South America,"5.3863,-66.0058",324,Yawarana,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of),VEN,Severely endangered,,,300.0,"Mosonyi and Mosonyi (2000), 'Manual de lenguas indígenas de Venezuela' ",5.3863,-66.0058,"San Juan de Manapiare (Amazonas), Venezuela",100.0,200.0
